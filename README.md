Hello, this is a repo for collecting my solutions for ODS RL course. Each week a new algorithm was implemented.
1. Evolutionary strategy (Cross-entropy method for discrete action space)
2. Evolutionary strategy (Cross-entropy method for continious action space)
3. Bellman Equation Simple Solver
4. Table algorithms - SARSA, Q-Learning, Monte-Carlo
5. DQN and its variations - Soft DQN, Hard DQN, Double DQN, N-step DQN, Dueling DQN, C51-DQN, QR-DQN.
6. PPO for continious and discrete action spaces, SAC for continious and discrete action spaces.
